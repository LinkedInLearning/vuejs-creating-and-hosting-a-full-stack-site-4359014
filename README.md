Do you have Vue.js front-end capabilities, but lack familiarity with the server side? Would you like to develop the skills needed to build full-stack applications? In this course, instructor Shaun Wassell helps you enhance your development tool kit by showing how to leverage your existing Vue.js skills to build a full-stack ecommerce site. Shaun guides you through the process, showing how to use Vue.js to build a simple front end; Node.js and MongoDB to construct the back end; Axios to communicate between the front and back ends; add authentication with Firebase Authentication; and finally, how to take it live. Along the way, learn how to work with different tools and frameworks to correctly configure your site, including Postman and Express.

## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The `main` branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.

When switching from one exercise files branch to the next after making changes to the files, you may get a message like this:

    error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:        [files]
    Please commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches.
    Aborting

To resolve this issue:
	
    Add changes to git using this command: git add .
	Commit changes using this command: git commit -m "some message"
